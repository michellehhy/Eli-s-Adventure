# Eli-s-Adventure

**A 2D maze game developed on Unity.**

Eli’s plane crashed on a deserted maze island and he’s lost his family... Help him escape the maze and the terrible monsters that lurk within so that he may be reunited with his family!

You must explore the maze and find the key to be able to escape! Then find the exit to complete the level!  Also, find the coins scattered around the maze!

The game mini map allows you to see where on the map you are! The map also shows the player and enemies!

Enemies are constantly roaming around the maze so watch out for them! Hit them with your fireball attack to lower their health!  Aim with the mouse and press the right button on the mouse to shoot a fireball at the enemy! If your health is low, find medicine to recover!

To remove obstacles in the players path just press the “O” key on the keyboard and the obstacle will disappear!

Unfortunately, if you run out of health the game is over but don’t worry! You will get the option to try the level again or to go back to the main menu.
